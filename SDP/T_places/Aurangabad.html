          <p class="card-text">The Bibi Ka Maqbara (English:Tomb of the Lady) is a tomb located in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was commissioned in 1660 by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the memory of his first and chief wife Dilras Banu Begum. It bears a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's mother, Mumtaz Mahal. Bibi Ka Maqbara is believed to have been built between 1668 and 1669 C.E. According to the "Tarikh Namah" of Ghulam Mustafa, the cost of construction of the mausoleum was Rs. 668,203-7 (rupees six lakh, sixty-eight thousand, two hundred three and seven annas) – Aurangzeb allocated only Rs. 700,000 for its construction. The comparison to the Taj Mahal has often obscured its very own considerable charm. Due to the strong resemblance, it is also called the Dakkhani Taj (Taj of the Deccan). Bibi Ka Maqbara is the "principal monument" of Aurangabad and its historic city.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Aurangabad caves are twelve rock-cut Buddhist shrines located on a hill running roughly east to west, close to the city of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The first reference to the Aurangabad Caves is in the great chaitya of Kanheri Caves. The Aurangabad Caves were dug out of comparatively soft basalt rock during the 6th and 7th century.

          The caves are divided into three separate groups depending on their location: These are usually called the "Western Group", with Caves I to V (1 to 5), the "Eastern Group", with Caves VI to IX (6 to 9), and a "Northern Cluster", with the unfinished Caves X to XII (9 to 12).
          The cave temples of Aurangabad carved between the 6th and the 8th century are nine kilometers from Aurangabad city center.
          the Aurangabad caves somewhat have been overshadowed by the UNESCO World Heritage monuments of Ellora and Ajanta cave temples. Though its sculptures are comparable to Ajanta and Ellora, the caves are much smaller.

            At a distance of 2 km from Bibi Ka Maqbara and 6 km from Aurangabad Railway Station, Sunheri Mahal is a palace located at the foothill of the Aurangabad Caves in the Paharsingpura area of Aurangabad. It is one of the top places to visit in Aurangabad.
            Soneri Mahal was built by a Bandalkand chief who accompanied Aurangzeb into the Dakhan. The Mahal was built between 1651 AD and 1653 AD at a cost of Rs.50, 000 and in 1934 AD it was sold to the Nizam of Hyderabad for Rs.26, 400. The Mahal is named after the paintings in the palace that were once painted in gold.
            It is a grand two stored building constructed in typical Rajput style. The palace is made up of lime and stone. Sprawling over two storeys, the palace stands as a testimony of Indian architectural splendor with some intricate decorations all over. A well-manicured garden adds to its beauty. The entrance of the Palace is decorated with beautifully done arches.

It is located in the northern part of the city. During the Mughal period, it was known as Khiziri Talab. It has been renamed after the great ornithologist, naturalist Salim Ali and also known as birdman of India.



          Salim Ali lake and its surrounding is rare and rich biodiversity spot within the city that hosts almost 16 tree species, 11 shrub types, 8 climbers, 32 terrestrial herbaceous plants, 10 varieties of algae, 12 of aquatic herbs, 16 aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans, nine varieties of fish, 15 species reptiles, seven types of rodents and mammals and 102 types of insects. Efforts are taken by environment activists and bird lovers in the city to close the historic Salim Ali Lake for public for the time being and declare it as a biodiversity hot spot for conservation.

          <p>In Aurangzeb's time, Khizri Talao extended the whole length of the northern wall, (extending from present day Salim Ali Lake till Begumpura / Makbara) but the exhalation and dampness proved unhealthy and Aurangzeb ordered the portion immediately in front of his palace (Kila-e-Ark) to be filled in and converted into fields. This reclaimed portion was later developed into Mughal garden, (now known as Himayat Bagh) by one of the officials of Aurangzeb's court, with many fruit-bearing trees of different varieties for the royal court and its officials</p>

The tower is located in the state of Maharashtra near the Daulatabad- Deogiri fort complex. It was erected in 1445 C.E by King Ala-ud-din Bahmani to commemorate his capture of the fort. Chand Minar bears resemblance to the Qutb Minar of Delhi and was inspired from it.

          The Chand Minar is considered to be among the finest specimens of Indo-Islamic architecture in Southern India. It is 63-metre high and is divided into 4 storeys and 24 chambers. A small mosque or praying hall sits at the base of the tower which is covered with Persian blue tiles. The Tower also displays some indigenous Indian architectural features such as the brackets supporting it's balconies[1] The tower's height makes it visible from every corner of the Daulatabad Fort.

        <p class="card-text">One of the best and well organised museums of the city, the History museum is a part of the History department of the University. The brain child of Late Dr. Ramesh Shankar Gupte, the museum started initially with plaster cast sculptures from the National Museum of Delhi for assisting the history students in a visual study of the sculptural development in India. Dr Gupte placed them chronologically and he felt the need for visual aids for the classes. Since the museum is located in the vicinity of the world famous caves of Ajanta and Ellora, the museum developed quickly. 

          The museum houses various artifacts ranging from 7th century to 12th century along with sculptures from Bhokardan and Daulatabad excavations; Sir Rao Bahadur Paranis' collection of original Pajput, Maratha and Mughal paintings; Dr. SB Deshmukh's collection of arms & armours, coins, textiles, semi-precious stones and excavation objects from Paithan.

          <p class="card-text">
            Most of the buildings in the dargah complex (including Panchakki) were erected by Turktaz Khan, a noble on the staff of Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah in about 1695 A. D. The oblong reservoir in front of the mosque and fountains were added 20 years later by Jamil Beg Khan. Dating back to the 17th century, this ingenious water mill was designed to use the energy generated by flowing water from a nearby spring to turn the large grinding stones of the flour mill. Shah Mosafar died in Hijri 1110. This watermill was used to grind grain for the pilgrims and disciples of saints as well as for the troops of the garrison.
            The arrangement is such that the water is made to fall into the Panchakki cistern from quite a height in order to generate the necessary power to drive the mill.
