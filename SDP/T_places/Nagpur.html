            It is one of the 11 lakes in Nagpur and is the largest lake in the city. The Nag River of Nagpur originates from this lake. 
            This was built in the year 1870, under Bhonsle rule, for supplying water to the city. 
            Government officials and eminent people were supplied water through clay pipes.
             This lake is near VNIT and surrounded by mango trees, gaining the name Ambazari as "Amba" means "mango" in Marathi. 
             The lake was used to supply water to Nagpur for over 30 years.
             Due to pollution, it is not currently used as a water supply.</p>

        </h5>
        <p class="card-text">Deekshabhoomi is a sacred monument of Navayana Buddhism located where the architect of the Indian Constitution, 
          B. R. Ambedkar, 
          converted to Buddhism with approximately 600,000 followers on Ashok Vijaya Dashami on 14 October 1956.
           Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism is deeply significant for millions of people in India. Deekshabhoomi is in Nagpur, Maharashtra, 
           a location regarded as a pilgrimage center of Buddhism in India. Millions of pilgrims visit Deekshabhoomi every year, especially on 
           Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din and 14 October, the memorial day when Ambedkar converted to Buddhism here. His final religious act was to
            embrace Buddhism. Today, the largest stupa in Asia is erected in his memory at the site. Deeksha literally means 'act of ordaining' 
            and bhoomi means the 'ground'. Deekshabhoomi means the ground where people got ordained as Buddhist. This religious mass conversion at 
            one place was the first ever of its kind in history. 
          Deekshabhoomi is one of two places of considered to be of great importance in the life of Ambedkar.</p>

            The zoo is located in the heart of the city and has been built on the garden of the Bhonsle and Maratha rulers of the city. 
            The zoo comes under the Central Zoo Authority of India and is maintained by the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth of Nagpur. 
            The zoo had come under scrutiny in 2006 for possible closure due to issues concerning animal healthcare but was cleared of all objections raised by CZA in 2007.
             The Government of Maharashtra has approved a new safari park of international standards next to Gorewada Lake in the city.
             Animals from Maharajbagh zoo would be moved to this new animal park but the older zoo will remain open for new animals</p>

        <p class="card-text">
          Sitabuldi Fort, a major tourist attractions in Nagpur, is situated on two hillocks: "Badi Tekri", literally meaning "big hill", and "Choti Tekri", meaning "small hill" in Hindi.
           The Sitabuldi hills, though then barren and rocky, were not entirely unoccupied. 
           Tradition holds that Sitabuldi got its name from two Yaduvanshi brothers â€“ Shitlaprasad and Badriprasad Gawali, who ruled the area in the 17th century. 
           The place came to be known as "Shitlabadri", which during British rule became "Seetabuldee", and later assumed its current form, "Sitabardi" or "Sitabuldi".
           The Battle of Sitabuldi was fought in November 1817 on these hillocks between the forces of Appa Saheb Bhonsle of Nagpur and the British.
          
           The fort was built by Mudhoji II Bhonsle, also known as Appa Sahib Bhosle, of the Kingdom of Nagpur, 
           just before he fought against the British East India Company during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. 
           The area surrounding the hillock, now known as Sitabuldi, is an important commercial hub for Nagpur.
